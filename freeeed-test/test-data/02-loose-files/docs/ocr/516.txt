Repairing Aluminum Wiring

ALUMINUM WIRING

On April, 28, 1974, two persons died in a home fire in Hampton Bays, New York Fire officials determined that the fire was caused by a faulty aluminum wire connection at an outlet

Since that tragic inicident, the U S Consumer Product Safety Commission staff and other government officials have investigated 
numerous complaints from homeowners throughout the nation who have had trouble with small gauge aluminum branch circuit wiring The 
Commission has also had research conducted that shows that homes wired with aluminum wire manufactured before 1972 ("old technology" 
aluminum wire) are 55 times more likely to have one or more connections reach "Fire Hazard Conditions" than is a home wired with copper

The hazard investigated by the Commission staff occur at connections to old technology aluminum wire, such as outlets or 
switches or at major appliances  such as dishwashers, furnaces, etc Corrosion of the metals in the connection, partially the aluminum 
wire itself, causes increased resistance to the flow of electric current and that resistance causes overheating

Homes built before 1965 are unlikely to have aluminum branch circuit wiring Homes built, rooms added, and circuits rewired or added 
between 1965 and 1973 may contain aluminum wiring

In 1972, manufactures modified both aluminum wire and switches and outlets to improve the performance of aluminum wired 
connections Sale of the old style wire, switches and outlets still on dealer's shelves however, continued after 1972

TROUBLE SIGNS

Signs of trouble in aluminum wire systems include warm-to-the-
touch face plates on outlets or switches, flickering lights, circuits that don't work, or the smell of burning plastic at outlets or switches
Unfortunately, not all failing aluminum wired connections provide such easily detected warning signs, aluminum wired connections have been 
reported to fail without any prior indications or problems

The survey conducted by the Franklin Research Institute defined "Fire Hazard 
Conditions" to occur when receptacle coverplate mounting screws reached 149C (300F), or sparks were emitted from the receptacle, or materials around 
the receptacle were charred
