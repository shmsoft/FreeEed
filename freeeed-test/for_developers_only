Necessary steps for tests to run

How to create your first 'settings.properties'
Copy settings-template.properties to settings.properties.
NOTE that settings.properties is ignored by git and will not be committed. It is safe to put your secret information
there - such as Amazon keys.

Add your Amazon keys, otherwise EC2 tests will fail.
