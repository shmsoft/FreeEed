Issues to be addressed on SHMcloud

* ActionStaging.java uses Java 7 way of handling files; do the same for PackageArchive.java
* Add a choice of AMI's to use (officially this is called imageID)
* Verify all operations to use the currently selected imageId only
* Use relative, not absolute paths to store files (don't forget \ or / for system separator)
* When packaging for staging, put the name of the custodian into a comment in a zip
* When packaging for staging, put the SHA-1 signature into a comment in a zip for each file
