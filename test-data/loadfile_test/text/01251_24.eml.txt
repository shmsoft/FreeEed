Craig,

Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use of form of Assignment.  Reason being that the last B of A deal (when using their document), which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.

Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA.  ENA

PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade would lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PCS today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this assignment.


Thanks,
Craig

Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.
