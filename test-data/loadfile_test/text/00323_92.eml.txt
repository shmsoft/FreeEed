The "Financial Trading Database" under Lotus Notes would be the definitive source regarding the Intercompany Master Agreements.

Let me know if you want be conduct such search.

I've been tasked with trying to get a handle on intercompany trading contracts. What would be the most efficient way of coming up with a list?

Thanks,
