Susan: My bad!  Maybe the payment combines two Williams entities and that would explain why they amount exceeds our invoice amount.

Shielah: Angelo gave me your name as a contact that could help with regard to cash inflows.  Please provide detail about the cash inflow from Williams on 3/5/02.  Specifically, which Williams company(s) provided the payment?  Thanks

Louis,

I have entered into the Demand Log the cash payment information for the counterparties listed below.

I have one question:

	According to the Cash Flow report -- the payment is noted from "Williams Energy Services Company", do we know for a fact that the monies relate to ENA's relationship with Williams Production RMT????

Susan

 << File: 030602daily direct cash flow.xls >> 
The above attached file contains validation of payment from:

Cross Oil's on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
San Diego Gas & Electric on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
Stone Energy Corporation on 3/6/02 for the full demand letter amount
Williams Production RMT on 3/5/02 for an amount considerably larger than the demand letter amount ($0.75M paid vs. $0.64 demand)

Please update the Demand Letter Log to reflect that their payment was received.  No termination letter will go to these CPs at this time.  

Thanks
