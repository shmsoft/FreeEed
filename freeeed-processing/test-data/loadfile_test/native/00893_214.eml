Diane,

I think its great that you asked Melissa -- it would be fine if your lists are intergrated, that would be great.

OK - I'll ask Melissa to send you her power list separately.

Diane,

I too noted that BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. had terminated by mutual termination; however, include them on your list for the time being.

Thanks.

FYI:  thanks for including Melissa -- I had sent her a separate email as we had spoken over the phone concerning the project request.

Susan,

BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. was marked as a "Y" for termination on the latest Letter Log and Master Termination Log we received from Stephanie Panus....so do we include them in the list or not?  I was in the process of sending their list of deals over to Risk to be swung into the Bankruptcy books.  

Melissa - can you run this query for Power and send me a spreadsheet?  I'll merge it into whatever we find for Gas, Crude, Paper, Weather, etc...  for each counterparty?

Bob - can you do physical gas?  

Thanks,
Diane
