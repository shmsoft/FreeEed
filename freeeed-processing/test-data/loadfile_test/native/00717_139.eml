Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the "Confidentiality" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") or Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC").   I was asked to determine if the "Confidentiality" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) "the existence of a Master Agreement" or (b) "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the "Confidentiality" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose "the existence of a Master Agreement" or "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of "Confidentiality" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the "Confidentiality" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Cordially,

Susan,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Thanks for your help,
Jennifer Adams
