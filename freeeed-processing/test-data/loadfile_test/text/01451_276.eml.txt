He

> However, I was seeing 'his' charge, head on, at eye level, out of ammo 
and
> quite frankly nothing was going through my mind other than "OH SHIT!!! OH
> SHIT!!!! OH SHIT!!!!". I then heard Clay yell/holler/demand VERY loudly
> "DON'T MOVE!!!" ... and then BAMMMMM! I didn't move. My eyes were glued 
to
> the boar. Clay's shot nailed the old male in the left shoulder powering
> him
> ten feet to my left from the spot of impact as if he'd been kicked by a
> giant invisible boot, before he came to a sudden stop against a mesquite
> tree. Three shots in maybe 10 seconds, three dead javelinas,  blood and
> stink everywhere. Clay came running over to me yelling something like,
> "Are

hard,
> I
