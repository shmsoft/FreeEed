Alan,

Sorry for the late response, but Tuesday, February 19th was my birthday, and with the Monday holiday I decided to take a few extra days off.

But I am here today -- Thursday, February 21st.

If you have not got someone else to complete this task, I will be very happy to help.

Let me know.

Susan

I need your help in putting together a binder for Milbank Tweed/E&Y concerning one-way payment clauses in various gas and power contracts.

Please see me tomorrow about this. Many thanks.

Alan
