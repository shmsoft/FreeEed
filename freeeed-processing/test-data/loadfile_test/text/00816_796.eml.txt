WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to 
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

£ Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with 
current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
£ More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
£ Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
£ Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

£ Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) 
thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
£ All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
£ To Do Items
£ Journal Items
£ Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in 
the future will be converted.
£ Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will 
need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team
